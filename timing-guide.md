## Frame-based timing

I recommend to use the shortcuts for faster timing!

a) Click on a line you want to time
b) Go forward with ⇨ and backward with ⇦ to go to the desired video position
c) Set the start time of the line with button nr. 3 to that video position (use button nr. 4 to set the end time)
d) Go to the next line by pressing *ENTER* or *G*

You can quickly check with button nr. 1 and nr. 2 if you have timed your line correctly.

- Play the audio of your timed line by pressing *S*
- Play 500ms before your selection by pressing *Q* and 500ms after with *E*
- Go to the next line by pressing *ENTER* or *G*
